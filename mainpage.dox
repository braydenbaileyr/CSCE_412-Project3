/**
 * @mainpage Load Balancer Simulation
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 * This project simulates a web request load balancer for a large company.
 * Random requests are generated with input and output IPv4 addresses, a
 * processing time, and a job type. The load balancer distributes those
 * requests to active web servers and dynamically adjusts server count based on
 * queue size.
 *
 * @section features Features
 * - Random request generation with IPv4 source and destination addresses
 * - Request queue managed with a FIFO structure
 * - Dynamic web server scaling based on queue thresholds
 * - Firewall blocking for a configured IP range
 * - Persistent event logging to a log file
 *
 * @section workflow Workflow
 * The program reads user input for the initial server count, scaling buffer,
 * and blocked firewall range. It fills an initial queue, starts the simulation
 * loop, adds new requests over time, and allows each server to process queued
 * work one clock cycle at a time.
 *
 * @section files Code Organization
 * - LoadBalancer manages the queue, scaling logic, and simulation clock
 * - WebServer represents a worker that processes requests
 * - Request stores the data for one request
 * - Firewall blocks requests from a configured IP range
 * - Logger writes simulation events to the log file
